Todos for first deadline
- Make webpage pretty
- Add description to webpage
- Add google vision/microsoft lens ai thingies (in db perhaps?)
- Add readme to explain to first run create_database, then load_images and then tolokaApp. (Only start the pool when also running the app.py, else images won't load)
- Also did you know you need a second account to answer the questions in the sandbox? https://yandex.com/support/toloka-requester/concepts/sandbox.html (You don't need to use your phone number)
- Store pool results in the DB

Todos for second question:
- Make new webpage with interactions, (like playing a game)
- Add result collection as new table to the database, think of how best to store the results.
